The purpose of the game is to reveal all the cells on the board that do not contain a mine.
Reveal a cell by clicking on it. You lose if you click on a mine cell.

Every non-mine cell you reveal will display the total number of mines surrounding it.
Once you determine that a certain cell contains a mine, right click on it to flag it.
You win if you reveal all the non-mine cells.
